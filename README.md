# Satellite Telemetry Analysis ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a simple telemetry data analysis pipeline using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It processes satellite UHF telemetry data and visualizes key parameters such as battery temperature and radio signal strength (RSSI).

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Loaded and cleaned telemetry data
- Converted timestamp for time-series analysis
- Visualized:
  - Battery Temperature trends
  - Radio Signal Strength (RSSI) variations

## ðŸš€ Example Plot
Battery temperature over time:

## ðŸ’¡ Why this project?
I built this project to practice telemetry data analysis, which is crucial in satellite engineering and flight data tools development.  
It shows my ability to handle real-world data, preprocess it, and extract useful insights.
